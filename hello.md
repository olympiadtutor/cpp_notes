## Basics of Hello World

- **Statement**: An instruction in a computer program that tells the computer to perform an action.
- **Function**: A collection of statements that executes sequentially.
- **Preprocessor directive**: Instructs the preprocessor, a program that processes source code before compilation, to tell the compiler to include a file in the source code program. Ex: _#include_, _#define_
- **Main**: All program must have _main()_ function. Execution will start from first statement inside _main()_ function
- **Syntax**: Grammer rules of C++ language

## Compiler

- The compiler is a program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language (e.g., C, C++, Java) into machine code or an intermediate representation.
- It performs syntax and semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation to produce executable files or object code.
- Common compilers include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), Clang, and Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler.

## Linker

- The linker is a program that combines multiple object files generated by the compiler into a single executable program or library.
- It resolves references to external symbols, resolves dependencies between different modules, and performs address assignment.
- The linker generates the final executable or library by combining the object files along with any required system libraries or external dependencies.
- Examples of linkers include GNU ld (Linker), Microsoft Linker (link.exe), and LLVM's lld.

## Libraries

- Libraries are collections of precompiled routines, functions, and data that provide commonly used functionality to programs.
- They can be static or dynamic. Static libraries are linked directly into the executable, while dynamic libraries are loaded at runtime.
- Libraries can be system libraries provided by the operating system or third-party libraries developed by other programmers.
- Common libraries include the C Standard Library (libc), C++ Standard Library (libstdc++, libc++), and platform-specific libraries like Windows API or POSIX libraries.
