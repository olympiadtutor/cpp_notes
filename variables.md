**Data** : Any information that can be moved, processed, or stored by a computer.  
**Object** : A region of storage (usually memory) that can store a value. In C++ objects can be unnamed or named.  
**Variable** : An object with a name. At runtime, the variable is instantiated i.e. an object is created and assigned a memory.  
**Data Type** : Tells the compiler what type of value the variable will store. The type must be known at compile-time.  
**Initialization** : Assigns the initial value for an object.
- Copy Initialization :```cpp
  int width = 5
  ```
